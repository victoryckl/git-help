The following is the new method for pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3:

sudo apt-get install build-essential fakeroot dpkg-dev
mkdir ~/python-pycurl-openssl
cd ~/python-pycurl-openssl
sudo apt-get source python-pycurl
sudo apt-get build-dep python-pycurl
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev
sudo dpkg-source -x pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3.dsc
cd pycurl-7.19.0
# remove the HAVE_CURL_GNUTLS=1 in the following file
sudo vim debian/patches/10_setup.py.dpatch
# remove the HAVE_CURL_GNUTLS=1 in the following file
sudo vim setup.py
# replace all gnutls into openssl in the following file
sudo vim debian/control
sudo dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -b
sudo dpkg -i ../python-pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3_amd64.deb

Thanks for sharing this. During the last step, I get the following error. Do you have any clues? $ sudo dpkg -i ../python-pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3_amd64.deb dpkg: error processing ../python-pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3_amd64.deb (--install): cannot access archive: No such file or directory Errors were encountered while processing: ../python-pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3_amd64.deb – Arun Jayapal Nov 23 '12 at 10:14

@user1514027 I suppose it depends on the exact .deb file name built by the previous step (the dpkg-buildpackage). You need to have a look and search for the actual name generated. – VonC Nov 23 '12 at 10:16
It works. Thank you very much – Arun Jayapal Nov 24 '12 at 7:25
I followed this solution, deviations included the source source file presenting as pycurl_7.19.0-3.dsc instead of pycurl_7.19.0-4ubuntu3.dsc. I also found it necessary to NOT edit patch file, doing so caused an MD5 failure on the build. – 2NinerRomeo Feb 7 at 18:54

In the end, the behavior is unchanged, perhaps I need to find a way to really stop that macro from being defined. Perhaps I can manually make the changes to setup.py and stop the patch from being applied? – 2NinerRomeo Feb 7 at 18:56
